## 🕹️ Overview
We created this project to solve the problem of using artificial intelligence (AI) in art, especially art that produced by AI. AI provides many benefits, but if its uncontrolled, it can cause problems such as plagiarism, pirating, and economic loss for the original artist who created the art. 

We create a solution to the problem by building AI models that can detect whether the art or the image is an AI generated image. To create the models, we took the datasets from:
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravidussilva/real-ai-art
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielmao2019/deepfakeart

The models that we created consists of 5 models, 3 deep learning models, and 2 machine learning models with different feature extraction method. Here are the models that we created: 
- ResNet50V2
- Xception
- XGBoost with HSV
- Random Forest with HSV
- XGBoost with HSV + Edge Detection
- Random Forest with HSV + Edge Detection
- XGBoost with MPEG7
- Random Forest with MPEG7
