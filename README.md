## 🕹️ Overview
We created this project to solve the problem of using artificial intelligence (AI) in art, especially art that produced by AI. AI provides many benefits, but if its uncontrolled, it can cause problems such as plagiarism, pirating, and economic loss for the original artist who created the art. 

We create a solution to the problem by building AI models that can detect whether the art or the image is an AI generated image. To create the models, we took the datasets from:
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravidussilva/real-ai-art
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielmao2019/deepfakeart

The models that we created consists of 5 models, 3 deep learning models, and 2 machine learning models with different feature extraction method. Here are the models that we created: 
- ResNet50V2
- Xception
- XGBoost dengan feature extraction HSV
- Random Forest dengan feature extraction HSV
- XGBoost dengan feature extraction HSV + Edge Detection
- Random Forest dengan feature extraction HSV + Edge Detection
- XGBoost dengan feature extraction MPEG7
- Random Forest dengan feature extraction MPEG7
